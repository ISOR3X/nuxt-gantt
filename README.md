# Nuxt Gantt
Gantt charts for Nuxt UI.

A work in progress project for creating gantt charts. 

## Features
1. 2D virtualization: Both the grid and tasks are virtualized, meaning in theory you can have an infinite number of tasks for a project of an infinite duration. Every project managers' dream!
2. ...more to come!

## Plans
1. Tasks saving and loading (JSON)
2. Task editing: dragging with handles, colors, renaming etc.
3. Dependency arrows
4. Turn it an actual shareable library
5. Create a demo page

This library was inspired by the Gantt chart found in MS Planner, [Umay Gantt Chart builder](https://github.com/aligundogdu/Umay-Gantt-Chart-Builder) and of course Nuxt UI itself for creating stylable components.
