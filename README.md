# Nuxt Gantt

Gantt charts for Nuxt UI.

A work in progress project for creating gantt charts.

## Features

1. 2D virtualization: Both the grid and tasks are virtualized, meaning in theory you can have an infinite number of tasks for a project of an infinite duration. Every project managers' dream!
2. Save and load tasks to JSON

## Plans

1. Task editing: colors, renaming etc.
2. Dependency arrows
3. Turn it an actual shareable library
4. Create a demo page

This library was inspired by the Gantt chart found in MS Planner, [Umay Gantt Chart builder](https://github.com/aligundogdu/Umay-Gantt-Chart-Builder) and of course Nuxt UI itself for creating stylable components.
